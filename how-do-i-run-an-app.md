All apps in Eloquent Store are packaged as [AppImages](http://appimage.org), this means that you can download and run any app with very little effort, no matter what Linux distribution you're using.

Once you have an app on your system, you'll need to make it executable. You can do this using your distributions file manager or by running the following command in the terminal.

```
chmod a+x MyApp.AppImage
```
